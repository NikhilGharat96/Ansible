**** Ansible: A Powerful Automation Tool for DevOps ****

* What is Ansible?
Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application
deployment, IT orchestration, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It helps DevOps teams automate
repetitive tasks and manage large-scale IT infrastructure efficiently.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

* Key Features of Ansible:
--> Agentless: Unlike other tools like Puppet or Chef, Ansible does not require installing any agents on managed nodes.
--> Uses YAML (Playbooks): Configurations are written in YAML, making them easy to read and understand.
--> Idempotent: Ensures that tasks are only executed if changes are needed, preventing unnecessary modifications.
--> SSH-Based Communication: Uses SSH for Linux and WinRM for Windows, simplifying remote execution.
--> Scalable & Lightweight: Can manage thousands of nodes without consuming too many resources.
--> Declarative & Procedural: Supports both declarative (desired state) and procedural (step-by-step) approaches.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Common Use Cases:
--> Configuration Management: Automating system settings, user creation, package installations, etc.
--> Application Deployment: Deploying and updating applications across multiple servers.
--> Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Managing cloud resources on AWS, Azure, or GCP.
--> Orchestration: Automating workflows across multiple services.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

* Basic Ansible Architecture:
--> Control Node: The machine where Ansible is installed and executed.
--> Managed Nodes: The machines being configured or automated.
--> Inventory: A file that lists the managed nodes.
--> Playbooks: YAML files defining tasks to execute on managed nodes.
--> Modules: Pre-built functions for automation tasks.
